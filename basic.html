            <h2>LET'S BEGIN</h2>

            <p>To start creating trap drums, the first step is to choose a suitable DAW (Digital Audio Workstation),
                such as FL Studio, Ableton Live or Logic Pro X, as they offer intuitive tools for working with beats.
                Next, it's essential to gather a set of high-quality samples, including kicks, snares, claps, hi-hats
                and 808s, which are the foundation of trap's signature sound. Adjust your project's BPM to somewhere
                between 130 and 180, depending on the style you want to produce. From there, you'll be ready to create
                drum patterns and explore rhythmic variations.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>You will need sounds, Download a good quality trap sample pack, containing kicks, snares, claps,
                        hi-hats, and 808s. Adjust the BPM to somewhere between 130 and 180 depending on the style you
                        want. Load your samples onto individual channels or use a sampler to easily control them.</p>
                    <p>A sample pack is a collection of pre-recorded sounds used in music productions. In the context of
                        trap, these packs often contain the essential elements for building complete tracks, such as
                        drums, melodies, and effects. They are indispensable tools for beginners and professionals, as
                        they speed up the creative process and offer ready-to-use sounds.

            <h2>HI-HATS</h2>

            <p>The hi-hat is one of the most important elements in trap drums, being used to create rhythm, texture and
                energy in the tracks. In trap, hi-hat patterns are often characterized by quick and creative variations,
                which add movement and interest to the music. Here's a basic guide to understanding and creating hi-hat
                patterns:</p>

            <div class="music-production">
                <img src="hihat.PNG" alt="drill gang" class="image-right">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Creating a minimalist trap hi-hat pattern is about keeping it simple, while giving the beat an
                        interesting bounce. Here's how to do it:</p>
                    <p>As shown in the image to the side, one of the simplest and most effective ways to create a
                        pattern of hi-hats in the trap is by interspersing the spaces regularly, creating a sequence in
                        which the hi-hats play alternately. This approach brings a clear and steady rhythm, providing
                        the solid foundation for the rest of the song. Simplicity here is key, as it allows other
                        elements like the kick, 808, and vocals space to shine without the drums becoming overly busy.

        <div class="intro-text">
            <h2>CLAP</h2>

            <p>The clap is a fundamental element in trap drums, especially because it helps to give that characteristic
                groove and rhythmic marking. Unlike the snare, which can also be used, the clap has a snappier and
                generally drier sound, which makes it perfect for adding emphasis and clarity to the rhythm.
            </p>

            <div class="music-production">

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The clap is usually placed on the third beat of each measure, that is, on the second and fourth
                        beats in a 4/4 bar. As shown in the image to the side, each vertical bar is a measure.</p>

                    <p>Standard Clap Sound: The trap clap is generally a dry sound, with little reverb, so as not to
                        lose clarity. Can be used alone or layered with the snare to create a fuller sound.
                    </p>

                    <p>This creates a basic and constant drum pattern, where the kick (usually on the first and third
                        beat) marks the strong beats, while the clap brings rhythmic emphasis to the weak beats.</p>

            <h2>808</h2>

            <p>The 808 is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic and essential elements in the production of trap and
                many other modern genres, such as hip-hop and rap. That deep, powerful sound isn't just bass; it also
                acts as one of the music's main rhythmic engines, shaping the foundation and feel of a track. Let's
                understand how the 808 works and how you can use it effectively in trap production.</p>

            <div class="music-production">
                <img src="808.PNG" alt="drill gang" class="image-right">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The 808 in trap is used both to create a melodic base and to provide a deep rhythmic impact. It
                        can be treated as a traditional bass, but its use goes far beyond that, being one of the main
                        responsible for the weight and the "boomboom" sensation in the tracks.</p>

                    <p>Bass and Deep: The 808 is a sound with large low frequencies, which can be felt as much as or
                        more than heard, especially in high-quality audio systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>The tuning of the 808 is extremely important. Often, the 808 is tuned to complement the harmony
                        of the song, playing specific notes or creating a melodic effect rather than just serving as
                        background.</p>
