            <h2>FL STUDIO</h2>

            <p>FL Studio is a very popular DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) as it has a user-friendly interface and
                features ideal for beginners and professionals. To produce trap, FL Studio offers a wide library of
                samples and plugins such as Fruity Slicer and Gross Beat, which make it easy to create rhythms and
                melodic variations. Synth plugins like Sytrus and 3x Osc let you create custom 808 sounds and manipulate
                bass and sub-bass tones for a deeper, more immersive impact. Furthermore, FL Studio's piano roll is one
                of the most intuitive, allowing you to sequence notes and create melodies in a practical and quick way.
            </p>

            <div class="music-production">

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>To start producing trap in FL Studio, it is essential to understand the basic elements that make
                        up a typical track of the genre. The use of 808s — those deep, distorted bass — is one of the
                        most striking features. Furthermore, trap features fast, subdivided hi-hats, which generates a
                        sensation of speed and intensity in the tracks. Snares and striking claps are also common,
                        usually with the use of delay and reverb to fill more of the sound space.</p>

                    <p>The introduction to trap in FL Studio therefore involves understanding the tools available in the
                        program and experimenting with different combinations of samples and effects. By exploring
                        resources and developing their own style, the producer can achieve unique sounds, approaching
                        the sound of prominent artists and, at the same time, imprinting their own identity on the
                        productions.

                <h2>MAIN TOOLS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Channel Rack:</strong> The Channel Rack is where you organize and sequence the basic
                        sounds and samples of your beat.</li>
                    <li><strong> Piano Roll:</strong> FL Studio's Piano Roll is one of the most complete and intuitive
                        tools for creating melodies and sequencing notes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mixer:</strong> The Mixer is essential for the individual treatment of elements and for
                        balancing the track as a whole.</li>

            <h2>CHANNEL RACK</h2>

            <p>The Channel Rack in FL Studio is the central point for organizing and sequencing all the rhythmic and
                melodic elements of a track. It works as a kind of "toolbox" where you insert samples, sounds,
                synthesizers and other instruments, and then arrange them into patterns and sequences. The Channel Rack
                is where you build the basic building blocks of your music, and it is especially useful for trap
                production, which requires detailed and organized rhythmic construction.</p>

            <div class="music-production">
                <img src="channelrack.PNG" alt="drill gang" class="image-right">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In the Channel Rack, each element (such as a kick, snare, hi-hat, or 808) is displayed on
                        individual lines. By clicking on the squares next to the name of each sound, you create steps to
                        sequence these elements, forming rhythmic patterns. For example, you can click different steps
                        to create a fast, consistent hi-hat beat, essential for trap music. Visual repetition of steps
                        makes it easier to build complex beats.</p>

                    <p>In Channel Rack, you can add native FL Studio plugins (like Fruity Reeverb or Fruity Delay) to
                        adjust the sound directly in the rack, or even third-party plugins. This means you can insert
                        additional effects and instruments without having to leave this window, which saves time and
                        facilitates your workflow.

            <h2>PIANO ROLL</h2>

            <p>FL Studio's Piano Roll is one of the most powerful and intuitive tools for creating and editing melodies,
                harmonies, and rhythmic sequences. It allows producers to draw notes and define their duration,
                intensity and exact placement, offering fine control over the musical composition. This tool is
                especially useful in genres like trap, where dark melodies, 808 lines, and rhythmic variations of
                hi-hats play an important role.</p>

            <div class="music-production">

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In Piano Roll, you can directly click on the virtual keys to insert notes, adjusting their
                        duration by dragging horizontally. This makes it easier to create complex melodies and repeating
                        patterns, since you can view and control each note individually. For trap, this function is
                        essential for creating engaging melodies, usually in smaller scales to bring a darker and more
                        melancholic atmosphere to the track.</p>

                    <p>Below the Piano Roll, there is a section called Velocity that allows you to adjust the intensity
                        of each note. This is useful for adding variation and dynamics, especially in hi-hat patterns
                        where it's common to vary the speed to create a more realistic, pulsating effect. The speed
                        control helps give a different bounce and texture to each element, which enriches the beat.

            <h2>MIXER</h2>

            <p>The FL Studio Mixer is one of the most essential tools for the process of mixing and finalizing a track,
                allowing each sound element to be adjusted individually and precisely. The Mixer is responsible for
                receiving and processing all sounds from the Channel Rack, applying effects, controlling volumes,
                equalizing frequencies and spatially organizing the elements. For trap productions, where bass, 808s,
                and hi-hats need to stand out, the Mixer is key to ensuring each sound has its own space and clarity in
                the mix.</p>

            <div class="music-production">
                <img src="mixer.PNG" alt="drill gang" class="image-right">
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Each audio element in the Channel Rack can be assigned to a specific channel in the Mixer. This
                        allows you to organize and route different instruments to specific channels, such as placing all
                        percussion sounds (kicks, snares and hi-hats) on their own channels or grouping all synthesizer
                        elements into the same subgroup. This type of organization makes it easier to control and apply
                        effects together, helping to create a more balanced mix.</p>

                    <p>The Mixer offers precise volume control for each channel, essential for adjusting the balance of
                        each element of the track. In trap, the 808 and kick need to be loud enough to create impact,
                        but without masking the other elements.
